*Welcome to _db2unit_ and thanks for contributing to this project.*

There are different ways to contribute to this project. For example if you find a bug or you want to propose a new feature, you can create an issue. Also, if you have developed something and you want that your code to be integrated in the trunk, you can create a pull request (you should have forked this project before). Finally, if you have found a particular way to use db2unit, you can share with us your experience by writing an article in the Wiki; it is very important that users describe their experience with this framework.

Your contributions are welcome in this project!

## Bugs

If you found a bug and you are creating an issue, please describe as much as
possible the environment where you execute this framework:

 * Platform (OS, version, architecture (32/64 bits))
 * DB2 (edition, version, fixpack)
 * Dependency (log4db2 version)
 * Utility (version)

And please explain us what you did, what you got, and what you did not get
as you expected.

Do not worry about labels or milestones, once we will see your issue, we will
assign the corresponding values.

## Develop

If you develop a new feature (bug fix, enhancement, etc.) and you want that
feature be integrated in the project, please make sure you wrote some tests,
in order to help us verify that this feature does not get into conflict with
the existing. Remember that this project has been developed as TDD
(Test-driven development).

This project follows a code convention. Please try to follow it in order to
have a standard code across all contributions:
