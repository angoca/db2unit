* AFTER: Once the release has been done, some extra tasks to prepare the env.

BEFORE

* Run all tests to make sure there are not regressions.
* Change the version constant in the code (07-Version.sql:VERSION):
https://github.com/angoca/db2unit/blob/master/src/main/sql-pl/07-Version.sql
* Write the changes in the ChangeLog section of the wiki.
* Update the Prerequisites table from the Install section of the wiki.
* Change the version in the documentation (Version:) of all source files.
* Make sure the schema reflects the version number to release (all files.)

* Read the code again.
* Review the wiki (all pages).
* Perform last commit and push.

* Execute mvn release:prepare providing a valid TAG (1-Beta, 1) and a SNAPSHOT
